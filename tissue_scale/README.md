# BRCA1-ONSET Tissue-Scale Model (10^7 Susceptible Cells)

Standalone, fully reproducible package for the tissue-scale extension of **BRCA1-ONSET**.

This module scales the virtual population from the cellular-scale 500-cell representation to an intact virtual tissue with **10^7 susceptible epithelial cells**, retains the clinical tumor-positive endpoint of 5% mass (**5×10^5 transformed cells**), models finite post-transformation clonal expansion via effective doubling time $\tau_T$, and incorporates inter-individual variation in the $D_2$-dependent tissue restraint threshold $\theta_{D2}$ via a log-normal distribution.

## 🔬 Scientific Highlights & Calibrated Behavior

From the frozen independent 10,000-tissue validation (`data/final_multiobjective_validation_10000.csv`):
- **Clinical penetrance agreement**: cumulative penetrance at ages 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 is **5.78%, 24.65%, 42.86%, 56.50%, 65.98%, 72.57%**.
- **Minimal weighted discrepancy**: $wSSE = 4.15$ against Kuchenbaecker et al. (2017) clinical cohort data.
- **Somatic BRCA1 loss majority**: **92.50%** of emerging tumors are dominated by BRCA1-null cells (>50% null mass).
- **Subclonal retention of heterozygosity**: **21.63%** of BRCA1-loss-majority tumors retain $\ge 25\%$ BRCA1$^{+/-}$ cells, reproducing clinical intratumor heterogeneity.
- **Emergent polyclonal initiation**: **28.10%** of tumors possess $\ge 2$ substantial founder lineages ($\ge 5\%$ each), demonstrating age-dependent founder dynamics without founder number being fitted directly.

## 📊 Generated Figures

### 1. Main Text Figure 6 (`Figure6.pdf`, `Figure6.png`)
- **Panel a**: Cumulative penetrance comparison (Observed 95% CI vs Homogeneous restraint vs Variable $D_2$ restraint).
- **Panel b**: Age-stratified somatic BRCA1 loss composition in emerging tumors (BRCA1$^{+/-}$ predominant, Mixed, BRCA1$^{-/-}$ predominant).
- **Panel c**: Distribution of substantial founder lineages across age at first tumor detection (Kendall's $\tau_b = -0.11, p = 1.05 \times 10^{-23}$; reference $\chi^2 = 121.96, p = 1.79 \times 10^{-17}$).

### 2. Supplementary Figure S7 (`FigureS7.pdf`, `FigureS7.png`)
- **Panel a**: Cumulative penetrance fit under the homogeneous tissue restraint model ($wSSE = 48.96$).
- **Panel b**: Systematic trade-off between early/mid-life discrepancy (ages 30–50) vs late-life discrepancy (ages 60–80) across grid configurations.
