# cellSim

[![CI](https://github.com/pujana-lab/cellSim/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pujana-lab/cellSim/actions)

A domain-driven, open-source C++20 framework for stochastic tumour evolution simulation.
CellSim models the progressive genomic corruption of a cell population through a biologically
grounded lifecycle (TP53 / BRCA1 two-hit inactivation, DNA damage accumulation, immune evasion)
within a clean hexagonal architecture designed for reproducibility and extensibility.

> **Academic context:** CellSim is a proof-of-concept at the intersection of software engineering
> and computational oncology. See `docs/paper2/intro_related_work.pdf` for the full technical description.

## Calibration and validation

CellSim has been calibrated against the cumulative breast-cancer risk curve of Kuchenbaecker et al. (JAMA, 2017; ~6,000 *BRCA1* carriers). An ABC-SMC Bayesian refinement (SSE = 0.92, all 6 age points within the clinical 95% CI) revealed a significant anticorrelation between the heterozygous damage-accumulation rate and the neoplastic division rate (r = −0.609, p < 10⁻²¹), which resolves into two distinct, statistically separable tumor-progression phenotypes sharing the same onset age but diverging significantly in colonization speed (p < 0.001).

See [`docs/CALIBRATION_AND_PHENOTYPES.md`](docs/CALIBRATION_AND_PHENOTYPES.md) for the full calibration methodology, posterior analysis, biological interpretation, and limitations.

## Executables

| Binary | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cellSim` | Batch simulation — 100 runs with default parameters |
| `cellSim_cli` | JSON-configurable simulation (recommended entry point) |
| `interactive` | Manual mutation control, verbose per-year logging |

## cellSim_cli — Configurable Entry Point

```bash
./build/cellSim_cli --config configs/default.json
./build/cellSim_cli --config configs/default.json --seed 42 --cells 1000 --max-t 80
./build/cellSim_cli --config configs/high_tp53.json --verbose
```

### CLI options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--config <path>` | JSON configuration file (required) |
| `--seed <n>` | Random seed; -1 = random |
| `--cells <n>` | Cell population size |
| `--max-t <n>` | Simulation length in ticks (≈ years) |
| `--verbose` | Enable detailed logging |
| `--help` | Show full help |

### JSON structure

```json
{
  "config": {
    "seed": -1,
    "verbose": false,
    "use_random_noise": true
  },
  "simulation_context": {
    "max_t": 80,
    "n_cells": 1000

      "TP53":  { "mutation_rate": 0.001, "instability_rate": 0.002 },
      "BRCA1": { "mutation_rate": 0.001, "instability_rate": 0.002 }
    }
  }
}
```

Config templates: `configs/default.json`, `configs/high_tp53.json`, `configs/no_mutations.json`.

## Scenario Validation Suite

`run_all_scenarios` executes 17 predefined biological scenarios and writes traces to
`cmake-build-debug/traces/`:

| Group | Scenarios | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Baseline controls | 01–09 | No mutations → high TP53 load; establishes behaviour boundaries |
| Big Bang | 10–12 | TP53-/- cells acquire accelerated division; clonal dominance validation |
| Calibrated + lognormal noise | 13–15 | BRCA1 carrier profile (CV 0.3–0.5, N=1000–2000), 10 replicates each |
| Calibrated + constant noise | 16–17 | Same parameters, deterministic increments; isolates stochastic contribution |

```bash
./build/run_all_scenarios
```

## Architecture

Three layers with strict inward dependency (no upward deps):

```
src/
├── application/        # Orchestration, CLI, SimulationConfig
├── domain/             # Pure business logic — no external dependencies
│   ├── cell/           # AgenticCell, CellLifeStage
│   ├── gene/            # Gene, Genome, GenomeFactory
│   ├── tissue/          # Tissue (container + lifecycle manager)
│   ├── signal/          # CellDivisionSignal, NeoplasmSignal
│   ├── ports/            # ICell, INoiseSource, ILogger interfaces
│   └── adapters/        # RandomNoise, FixedNoise, Logger, NullLogger
└── shared/              # Cross-cutting utilities, exceptions
```

Architectural decisions are documented as ADRs in `docs/adr/`.

## Biological Model (summary)

| Concept | Representation |
|---------|---------------|
| Tumour suppressors | TP53, BRCA1 — three allelic states (+/+, +/-, -/-), unidirectional |
| BRCA1 initial state | +/- (germline carrier) |
| DNA damage | Continuous accumulator D₁; threshold θ_{D₁} → PRIMER stage |
| Immunosuppression | Continuous accumulator D₂; threshold θ_{D₂} → TUMORAL stage |
| Cell stages | BASELINE → UNSTABLE → UNPROTECTED → PRIMER → TUMORAL (+ DEAD) |
| Apoptosis | Intrinsic (TP53-mediated) and extrinsic (immune-mediated) |

Thresholds θ_{D₁} and θ_{D₂} are calibrated against BRCA1 carrier penetrance data.
See [`docs/CALIBRATION_AND_PHENOTYPES.md`](docs/CALIBRATION_AND_PHENOTYPES.md) for the full calibration procedure and results.

> **Note:** `docs/README.md` currently describes an earlier model revision (e.g. instant BRCA1 -/- lethality in a fixed early phase) that predates the calibrated model documented here and in the paper. That file should be reconciled or superseded — see the open item in `docs/CALIBRATION_AND_PHENOTYPES.md`.

## Test Suite

82 unit tests across 11 test files (GoogleTest), running on every commit under GCC and Clang:

```bash
./build/tests/unit_tests
```

Coverage: gene mutation, genome construction, cell lifecycle ordering, apoptosis triggering,
life stage transitions, tissue population dynamics, stochastic noise behaviour.
