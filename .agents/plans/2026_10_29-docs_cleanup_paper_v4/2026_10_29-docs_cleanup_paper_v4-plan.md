# 🎯 Goal

Purge over 104 MB of obsolete legacy paper drafts, discarded hypotheses (such as Big Bang mode), superseded calibration traces, and outdated documentation in `docs/`, aligning the repository's documentation strictly with the published scientific manuscript **BRCA1-ONSET v4** (`/home/luis/Escritorio/abms/v4/Palomero_BRCA1_102126.txt`).

---

# 👀 Context

- **Manuscript v4 Location**: [`/home/luis/Escritorio/abms/v4`](file:///home/luis/Escritorio/abms/v4) (`Palomero_BRCA1_102126.txt`, `MainFigs_review_102126`, `SupplFig-Table-review_102126`)
- **Active Publication Pipelines**: [`experiments/`](file:///home/luis/CLionProjects/cellSim/experiments/) (`exp01_cs_...` to `exp09_ts_...`)
- **Official Deliverables**: [`results/paper_figures/`](file:///home/luis/CLionProjects/cellSim/results/paper_figures/)
- **Documentation Target**: [`docs/`](file:///home/luis/CLionProjects/cellSim/docs/)
- **Audit Document**: [`docs/DOCS_AUDIT_PAPER_V4.md`](file:///home/luis/CLionProjects/cellSim/docs/DOCS_AUDIT_PAPER_V4.md)

# 🪜 Phases

### Phase 1: Audit docs/ Against Manuscript v4 and Mark Obsolete Assets for Deletion
*(Recommended model: Gemini 3.8 Flash Medium)*
**Description:** Analyze every directory and document in `docs/` against the paper v4 text and figures at `/home/luis/Escritorio/abms/v4`. Classify each item by obsolescence criteria (discarded hypotheses, dead simulation runs, old Copilot configs, contradictory biology) and create a comprehensive audit report marking all obsolete assets for deletion without destroying files yet.
- [x] Ask and confirm with the user that the recommended model is active.
- [x] Deeply analyze `/home/luis/Escritorio/abms/v4` manuscript (`Palomero_BRCA1_102126.txt`) and review figures (`MainFigs_review_102126`, `SupplFig-Table-review_102126`).
- [x] Inspect and catalog all 23 items and subdirectories in `docs/` with disk usage and content comparison.
- [x] Generate comprehensive audit report [`docs/DOCS_AUDIT_PAPER_V4.md`](file:///home/luis/CLionProjects/cellSim/docs/DOCS_AUDIT_PAPER_V4.md) detailing exact obsolescence reasons and marking 12 folders and 11 files (~104.9 MB) for deletion.
- [x] Verify that existing tests and experiment smoke tests continue to pass (`make test`).
- [x] STOP. Present the changes to the user for review and suggest commit messages. Do NOT proceed to the next phase until the user explicitly asks.

---

### Phase 2: Execute Purge of Marked Assets & Align docs/README.md with BRCA1-ONSET v4
*(Recommended model: Gemini 3.8 Flash Low)*
**Description:** Permanently remove the marked obsolete folders and files from `docs/` (>104 MB freed), purge `docs/adr/`, rewrite `docs/README.md` and `docs/DOCS_AUDIT_PAPER_V4.md` in English to document the canonical BRCA1-ONSET model, states, parameters, and experiments as described in manuscript v4.
- [x] Ask and confirm with the user that the recommended model is active.
- [x] Remove the 12 marked obsolete directories in `docs/`: `paper/`, `paper2/`, `paper3/`, `paper4/`, `paper5/`, `paper6/`, `paper7/`, `papers/`, `paper20260828_1_validation_secondary/`, `paper20260907_transition_states/`, `diagrams_luis/`, `adr/`.
- [x] Remove the 11 marked loose obsolete files in `docs/`: `memoria-interna-calibracion.docx`, `BIG_BANG_MODE.md`, `CONTEXT_ENGINEERING_SUMMARY.md`, `PLAN_CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md`, `RESEARCH_CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md`, `QA_TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `AGENTIC_CELL_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `model_transitions_spec.md`, `diagrams.md`, `openmp_optimization.md`, `CODEBASE_MANUSCRIPT_AUDIT.md`.
- [x] Modernize and rewrite [`docs/README.md`](file:///home/luis/CLionProjects/cellSim/docs/README.md) in English to accurately summarize the BRCA1-ONSET v4 architecture, cell states (Normal, Primed, Tumoral), parameters ($\omega_1, \omega_2$), and references to the 9 vertical slices in `experiments/`.
- [x] Translate [`docs/DOCS_AUDIT_PAPER_V4.md`](file:///home/luis/CLionProjects/cellSim/docs/DOCS_AUDIT_PAPER_V4.md) into English.
- [x] Verify repository integrity and test suites with `make test && make exp-smoke-all`.
- [x] STOP. Present the changes to the user for review and suggest commit messages.

# ⏭️ Next Step

All phases of the plan are complete!
The `docs/` folder has been thoroughly cleaned of 104.9 MB of legacy residue and now solely contains clean, publication-ready documentation in English aligned with the published manuscript v4.
