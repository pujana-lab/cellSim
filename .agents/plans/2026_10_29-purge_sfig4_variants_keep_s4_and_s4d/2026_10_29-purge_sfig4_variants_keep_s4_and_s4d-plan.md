# 🎯 Goal

Consolidate Supplementary Figure S4 in `experiments/exp03_cs_abc_smc_calibration` down to strictly two canonical figures:
1. **Figure S4**: Canonical $4 \times 4$ joint posterior parameter corner matrix (marginal KDEs + bivariate contour maps).
2. **Figure S4b** (formerly S4d): 1D posterior density KDEs and 95% CrIs of all 6 pairwise parameter ratios ($R = \theta_i / \theta_j$).

Purge obsolete variants (the former S4b cross-grid, former S4c self-strip, and former S4d artifacts), clean up `plot_sfig4.py`, update `Makefile` targets, update `results/paper_figures/export_all_figures.py`, and synchronize all project documentation (`experiments/exp03_cs_abc_smc_calibration/README.md`, `results/paper_figures/README.md`, and root `README.md`).

# 🪜 Phases

## Phase 1: Purge obsolete S4 variants, designate pairwise ratios as Figure S4b, clean code, Makefile and documentation

### Description
1. Remove obsolete generated image files (`FigureS4b.*` cross-grid, `FigureS4c.*` self-strip, and `FigureS4d.*`) from both `experiments/exp03_cs_abc_smc_calibration/` and `results/paper_figures/`.
2. Refactor `plot_sfig4.py`:
   - Rename `render_sfig4d_pairwise_ratios` $\to$ `render_sfig4b_pairwise_ratios` with internal figure label `"Supplementary Figure S4b"` and output stem `FigureS4b`.
   - Remove dead helper constants (`PARAM_LABELS`, `AXIS_LIMITS`, `TICKS`).
   - Support CLI choices: `4a`/`s4` (Figure S4), `4b`/`s4b` (Figure S4b), and `all` (both).
3. Update `Makefile`:
   - Keep targets `exp03-cs-sfig4` (Variant 4a) and `exp03-cs-sfig4b` (Variant 4b / pairwise ratios).
   - Update `exp03-cs-sfig4-all` to generate S4 and S4b.
   - Synchronize `.PHONY` and shortcut aliases (`exp03-sfig4`, `exp03-sfig4b`).
4. Update `results/paper_figures/export_all_figures.py` and `results/paper_figures/README.md` to track 13 canonical figures (39 publication files: PDF, PNG, EPS).
5. Update `experiments/exp03_cs_abc_smc_calibration/README.md` and repository root `README.md`.
6. Verify test suite (`make test`), smoke tests (`make exp-smoke-all`), and figure generation (`make exp03-cs-sfig4-all`, `make paper-figures`).

### To-do Actions List
- [x] Remove obsolete `FigureS4b.*`, `FigureS4c.*`, and `FigureS4d.*` files from `experiments/exp03_cs_abc_smc_calibration/` and `results/paper_figures/`.
- [x] Refactor `experiments/exp03_cs_abc_smc_calibration/plot_sfig4.py` to generate Figure S4 (canonical) and Figure S4b (pairwise ratios) cleanly.
- [x] Update `Makefile` targets, aliases, and `.PHONY` for `exp03-cs-sfig4` and `exp03-cs-sfig4b`.
- [x] Update `results/paper_figures/export_all_figures.py` to export canonical FigureS4 and FigureS4b.
- [x] Update `results/paper_figures/README.md` table to list Figure S4 and Figure S4b.
- [x] Update `experiments/exp03_cs_abc_smc_calibration/README.md` to document only S4 and S4b.
- [x] Update root `README.md` table of supplementary figures.
- [x] Verify execution with `make exp03-cs-sfig4-all`, `make paper-figures`, `make test`, and `make exp-smoke-all`.
- [x] STOP. Present the changes to the user for review and suggest commit messages.

# ⏭️ Next Step

All phases of this plan have been completed successfully. Supplementary Figure S4 (canonical corner plot) and Supplementary Figure S4b (pairwise ratios) are fully aligned, verified, and documented.
